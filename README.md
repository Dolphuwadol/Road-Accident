# Road-Accident
In this project, I performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and extracted insights from road accident data on the transportation network under the Ministry of Transport. I utilized PySpark and employed SQL queries to interrogate the data.

## Current Activities:
- Data Preparation
- Plotting maps from latitude and longitude
- Creating a clustering model
- Using the obtained cluster labels to build a Classification model
- Developing a time series model to predict accident occurrences
- Extracting satellite image data from Google Maps automatically
- Performing object detection on satellite images to identify dangerous curves and straight road segments
